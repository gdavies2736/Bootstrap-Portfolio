<h2>1. Description</h2>

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to demonstrate my skills to employers. There are six projects included in the portfolio, all with links to github repositories. There is also an about section and a skills section.

Here are screenshots showing my portfolio page:







<h2> 2. Issues </h2>

Initially using bootstrap, I found that there was a lot of new code contained within the classes for HTML elements and I was unsure of its meaning. When using a nav-bar I needed to read about and understand what each of the classes meant. 

Adding to this, I needed to read about how links worked on the page in order to understand how to get the nav-bar links to link to the correct place on the page.

<h2> 3. Usage </h2>

This project may be useful for anyone wishing to learn more about the front-end development projects I have completed including future employers.

The user can navigate to the different sections of the page by clicking on the top navigation.

It may also be useful for those learning how to build a portfolio using flex-box and understand more about:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
